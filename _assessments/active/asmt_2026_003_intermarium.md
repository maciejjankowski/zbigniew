# ZBIGNIEW Assessment: Intermarium Alliance Framework

**Assessment ID:** ASMT-2026-003
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Classification:** STRATEGIC
**Confidence:** 4/5

---

## Executive Summary

The Intermarium (Międzymorze) concept - a geopolitical alliance spanning from the Baltic to the Black Sea and beyond - represents Poland's most ambitious regional leadership opportunity. Originally conceived by Józef Piłsudski post-WWI, the concept has evolved through the Three Seas Initiative (3SI) and Bucharest Nine (B9) into practical implementation. This assessment analyzes the potential for expanding these frameworks to include historical allies with demonstrated pro-Polish sentiment: Turkey, Hungary, Romania, Iran, and the Nordic-Baltic states.

---

## 1. Historical Intermarium Concept

### 1.1 Piłsudski's Original Vision (1918-1939)

**Scope:** A federation of states between the Baltic, Black, and Adriatic Seas as counterweight to Russian and German imperialism.

**Proposed Members:**
- Core: Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine
- Extended: Finland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia
- Maximum: Scandinavia, Italy, Bulgaria, Greece (Arctic to Mediterranean)

**Why It Failed:**
1. Polish distrust from Czechoslovakia and Lithuania (border disputes)
2. Inter-regional tensions among potential members
3. Great power opposition (Germany, Soviet Union)
4. Lack of economic integration mechanism

**What Survived:** Only the Polish-Romanian Alliance (1921-1939) materialized as binding treaty.

### 1.2 Modern Implementations

| Framework | Founded | Members | Focus |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Three Seas Initiative (3SI) | 2016 | 13 EU states + partners | Infrastructure, energy, digital |
| Bucharest Nine (B9) | 2015 | 9 NATO states | Security coordination |
| NB8 | Various | 8 Nordic-Baltic | Security, defense |
| European Sky Shield (ESSI) | 2022 | 20+ | Air defense procurement |

### 3.2 Cui Bono Analysis

| Actor | Benefit | Risk |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Poland** | Regional leadership, security depth, economic corridors | Overextension, EU friction |
| **Baltic States** | Strategic depth, energy access | Dependency on Polish commitment |
| **Romania** | NATO flank reinforcement, 3SI investment | Competition for leadership |
| **Hungary** | Infrastructure investment, V4 cohesion | Russia policy divergence |
| **Turkey** | European foothold, NATO relevance | EU tensions, authoritarian concerns |
| **Finland** | Baltic defense integration | Drawn into Central European politics |
| **Iran** | Soft bridge to Europe | Sanctions complications |

### 3.3 Who Opposes

1. **Russia** - Directly threatened by encirclement
2. **Germany** - Reduced Central European dominance
3. **France** - Competing EU defense integration vision
4. **EU Commission** - Parallel structures challenge Brussels
5. **US (partially)** - Supports B9/3SI, wary of Turkey complexity

---

## 4. Pattern Recognition (ZBIGNIEW)

### 4.1 Historical Pattern: Failed Confederations

Every attempt at Central European confederation has failed when:
- Imposed from outside (Habsburg, Soviet)
- Led by dominant power seeking hegemony
- Lacking economic integration component
- Facing unified great power opposition

**Success conditions:**
- Voluntary, consensus-based
- Economic benefits clear and distributed
- External threat motivation
- Great power sponsor or neutrality

### 4.2 Current Opportunity Window

**Favorable Factors:**
- US supports Central European cohesion (counters Russia, hedges EU)
- Ukraine war demonstrates shared threat
- 3SI already institutionalized
- NATO membership provides security umbrella
- Energy independence creates common project

**Unfavorable Factors:**
- Hungary's Russia-friendly position
- EU-Turkey tensions
- Iran sanctions
- German economic leverage
- Internal V4 disagreements

### 4.3 Recommended Approach

**DO:**
- Build on existing institutions (3SI, B9) rather than creating new ones
- Emphasize infrastructure/economic benefits over military bloc rhetoric
- Cultivate historical narratives (shared memory diplomacy)
- Engage Turkey through NATO mechanisms
- Maintain soft cultural ties with Iran (diaspora, academic)
- Welcome Nordic states into B9/3SI orbit

**DON'T:**
- Frame as anti-EU or anti-German
- Push Hungary into Russia's arms with ultimatums
- Overcommit to South Caucasus complexities
- Expect Iran engagement beyond cultural level
- Seek formal alliance structures that trigger opposition

---

## 5. Specific Recommendations

### 5.1 Immediate (1 year)

1. **Turkey:** Propose bilateral defense industry cooperation (drones, ammunition)
2. **Romania:** Joint Black Sea security initiative, March 3 summit
3. **Hungary:** V4+ cultural diplomacy, avoid Russia ultimatums
4. **Finland:** Formalize B9+ participation, defense procurement coordination
5. **Iran:** Academic/cultural exchange only (Polish studies, refugee memorial)

### 5.2 Medium Term (5 years)

1. **3SI Expansion:** Associate membership for Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia
2. **Nordic-Baltic-Polish Corridor:** Defense industrial base integration
3. **Black Sea Strategy:** Romania-Poland-Turkey coordination
4. **Energy Independence:** Baltic-Black Sea pipeline/LNG network completion
5. **Historical Memory:** Polish-Iranian refugee memorial in Isfahan

### 5.3 Long Term (20 years)

1. **Intermarium Economic Zone:** Enhanced trade facilitation, infrastructure network
2. **Regional Defense Identity:** NATO-compatible but autonomous capability
3. **Cultural Soft Power:** Polish language/culture institutes across region
4. **Diaspora Network:** Poles in allied countries as cultural bridges

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### 6.1 Failure Modes

| Scenario | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Hungary defects to Russian orbit | 20% | High | Maintain V4 dialogue, avoid isolation |
| Turkey-EU break | 30% | Medium | Engage through NATO, bilateral |
| US withdraws from Europe | 15% | Critical | Accelerate European self-reliance |
| Germany blocks 3SI | 25% | Medium | Emphasize EU compatibility |
| Internal CE disputes | 40% | Medium | Mediation role, consensus building |

### 6.2 Red Lines

- No alliance structures outside NATO that could be seen as replacement
- No engagement with Iran that violates sanctions
- No forced choice between EU and Intermarium
- No exclusion of Germany from infrastructure benefits

---

## 7. Validation Criteria

**Prediction (5-year):** If Poland successfully leads 3SI/B9 expansion:
- 3SI membership or association will include Turkey by 2030
- Nordic-Baltic-Polish defense coordination will be formalized
- Romania will be Poland's closest bilateral partner
- Hungary will remain in structures despite Russia policy divergence

**Falsification:** If by 2028:
- 3SI stagnates below 15 members/partners
- Hungary exits V4 or B9
- Nordic states create separate defense bloc excluding Poland
- Turkey-Poland relations downgraded
