      - "Foundations before superstructure"
      - "Pilot before national rollout"
      - "Parallel tracks where independent"

    communication:
      - "Explain why, not just what"
      - "Honest about trade-offs"

# CLOSING PHILOSOPHY
# ============================================

closing:
  summary: |
    Strong Poland from Within means:
    - Economy that can't be weaponized against us
    - Society built on families, not state programs
    - Institutions that serve citizens efficiently
    - Identity that lives in hearts, not just laws
    - Security that protects without oppressing
    - Immigration that strengthens, not threatens
    - Technology we control, not that controls us
    - Defense that deters, with citizens prepared
    - Environment protected at our pace

    We don't build Poland for foreign approval.
    We build Poland for Poles - present and future.
    We are pragmatic, not ideological.
    We are confident, not aggressive.
    We remember our history.
    We build our future.

  guiding_quote: |
    "Polska nie zginęła, póki my żyjemy"
    Poland has not perished, as long as we live.

    This is not just a song. It's a commitment.
    Each generation inherits and must pass on.
    We are not the owners of Poland.
    We are its trustees.
