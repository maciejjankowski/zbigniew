# POLAND ALLIANCE DOCTRINE

# ZBIGNIEW Policy Framework v2.0

# ============================================
# CORE PHILOSOPHY
# ============================================

philosophy:
  name: "Solidarność przez Służbę"
  english: "Solidarity through Service"

  founding_principles:
    - principle: "Lead by Example, Not by Dominance"
      rationale: |
        Poland's historical attempts at dominance (Polonization, interwar period) created lasting
        resentment. Our strength comes from being indispensable, not from imposing our will.
        We serve the region; we don't rule it.

    - principle: "Trust is Earned, Not Assumed"
      rationale: |
        Polish history teaches that allies can abandon you (1939 France/UK passivity, 1944 Warsaw
        Uprising, Yalta). Trust must be calibrated based on demonstrated loyalty, not promises.
        We remember who stood with us and who stood aside.

    - principle: "Cultural Compatibility over Geopolitical Convenience"
      rationale: |
        Alliances built on shared values endure. Alliances built only on shared enemies collapse
        when the enemy changes. We prioritize partners who share our understanding of family,
        faith, freedom, and dignity - not just our fear of Russia.

    - principle: "Sovereignty is Non-Negotiable"
      rationale: |
        We were partitioned for 123 years. We know what loss of sovereignty means. Any alliance
        that requires surrendering decision-making authority is not an alliance - it's subjugation
        with better optics. We cooperate; we don't subordinate.

    - principle: "Reciprocity is the Foundation"
      rationale: |
        We do not give endlessly without receiving. We do not take without giving back.
        Partnerships must be mutual. Those who only take are not partners - they are parasites.
        Those who only give become servants.

  polish_way:
    description: |
      The Polish approach to alliance-building reflects our national character:
      - Hospitality to genuine friends, wariness toward strangers
      - Long memory for both kindness and betrayal
      - Preference for personal relationships over institutional frameworks
      - Skepticism of grand proclamations, respect for quiet action
      - Willingness to fight for principles, not just interests

    cultural_markers:
      - "We judge by deeds, not words"
      - "A friend in need is a friend indeed (Prawdziwych przyjaciół poznaje się w biedzie)"
      - "Trust but verify - and remember everything"
      - "Hospitality is sacred, but our home is not a hotel"
      - "We help those who help themselves"

defense_partnerships:
  description: |
    Defense industry partnerships exemplify the ideal: reliable delivery, technology sharing,
    mutual benefit, no political conditions. Two partners stand out as models.

    - "Long-term partnership over transactional deals"
    - "No political conditions accepted"

# ============================================
# ARMS PROCUREMENT FRAMEWORK
# ============================================

arms_procurement:
  description: |
    Arms procurement is not just military - it's strategic. Who supplies your
    weapons can become who controls your options. Poland must diversify suppliers,
    prioritize technology transfer, and build domestic capacity. No single partner
    should dominate any weapons category.

  core_principles:
    1_diversification:
      rule: "No single supplier > 40% of any weapons category"
      rationale: |
        Dependency creates leverage. If one supplier dominates, they can:
        - Delay deliveries for political reasons
        - Condition spare parts on policy compliance
        - Cut off ammunition in crisis
        - Use software updates as control mechanism
      implementation:
        - "Map current supplier percentages by category"
        - "Identify over-concentrated categories"
        - "Actively diversify future purchases"

    2_technology_transfer:
      rule: "Prioritize technology transfer over black box purchases"
      rationale: |
        Black box systems create permanent dependency. Technology transfer enables:
        - Domestic maintenance capacity
        - Independent upgrades
        - Export potential
        - Industrial base development
      good_examples:
        - "Korea K2/K9: Co-production in Poland, full tech transfer"
        - "Turkey Bayraktar: Potential joint development"
      bad_examples:
        - "US F-35: Black box, dependent on US for everything"
        - "US Patriot: Limited domestic maintenance capability"
      policy: "Future contracts must include technology transfer clause"

    3_domestic_capacity:
      rule: "Build sovereign production for critical systems"
      priorities:
        ammunition:
          status: "CRITICAL - tripling production"
          rationale: "Ammunition runs out first; cannot depend on imports in war"
          action: "Triple domestic ammunition production by 2030"
        maintenance:
          status: "HIGH PRIORITY"
          rationale: "If you can't fix it, you don't own it"
          action: "Domestic maintenance capability for all major systems"
        drones:
          status: "GROWING SECTOR"
          rationale: "Ukraine proved drones are future of warfare"
          action: "Expand Polish drone manufacturing"
        electronics:
          status: "MEDIUM PRIORITY"
          rationale: "Sensors and electronics are force multipliers"
          action: "Regional cooperation with 3SI partners"

    4_stockpiling:
      rule: "Maintain 5-10 year supply of critical spares"
      rationale: |
        Even reliable partners can become unreliable. Political changes,
        supply chain disruptions, or conflicts can cut off supplies.
      implementation:
        - "Identify critical spare parts for all major systems"
        - "Build strategic stockpiles (5-10 year supply)"
        - "Rotate stock to prevent obsolescence"
        - "Prioritize US-dependent systems (highest risk)"

  us_specific_guidance:

      The United States requires special consideration. As the dominant NATO

      note: |
        This is not anti-American. This is prudent. Poland values the US
        partnership. But partnership means mutual respect, not dependency.
        Any nation that depends entirely on one supplier has not learned
        from history.

  closing_principle: |
    Poland does not seek dominance. Poland seeks security through service.
    We build alliances not by demanding loyalty, but by earning trust.
    We remember who helped us when we needed help.
    We help those who share our values and respect our sovereignty.
    We are patient with differences but firm on principles.
    We lead from the front when needed and from behind when wiser.
    Our goal is not a Polish empire, but a Central Europe where
    all nations can live in freedom, dignity, and prosperity.

    "Międzymorze" is not about Polish leadership.
    It's about no one being left alone.
