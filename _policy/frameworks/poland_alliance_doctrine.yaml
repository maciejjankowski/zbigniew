# POLAND ALLIANCE DOCTRINE

# ZBIGNIEW Policy Framework v2.0

# ============================================
# CORE PHILOSOPHY
# ============================================

philosophy:
  name: "Solidarność przez Służbę"
  english: "Solidarity through Service"

  founding_principles:
    - principle: "Lead by Example, Not by Dominance"
      rationale: |
        Poland's historical attempts at dominance (Polonization, interwar period) created lasting
        resentment. Our strength comes from being indispensable, not from imposing our will.
        We serve the region; we don't rule it.

    - principle: "Trust is Earned, Not Assumed"
      rationale: |
        Polish history teaches that allies can abandon you (1939 France/UK passivity, 1944 Warsaw
        Uprising, Yalta). Trust must be calibrated based on demonstrated loyalty, not promises.
        We remember who stood with us and who stood aside.

    - principle: "Cultural Compatibility over Geopolitical Convenience"
      rationale: |
        Alliances built on shared values endure. Alliances built only on shared enemies collapse
        when the enemy changes. We prioritize partners who share our understanding of family,
        faith, freedom, and dignity - not just our fear of Russia.

    - principle: "Sovereignty is Non-Negotiable"
      rationale: |
        We were partitioned for 123 years. We know what loss of sovereignty means. Any alliance
        that requires surrendering decision-making authority is not an alliance - it's subjugation
        with better optics. We cooperate; we don't subordinate.

    - principle: "Reciprocity is the Foundation"
      rationale: |
        We do not give endlessly without receiving. We do not take without giving back.
        Partnerships must be mutual. Those who only take are not partners - they are parasites.
        Those who only give become servants.

  polish_way:
    description: |
      The Polish approach to alliance-building reflects our national character:
      - Hospitality to genuine friends, wariness toward strangers
      - Long memory for both kindness and betrayal
      - Preference for personal relationships over institutional frameworks
      - Skepticism of grand proclamations, respect for quiet action
      - Willingness to fight for principles, not just interests

    cultural_markers:
      - "We judge by deeds, not words"
      - "A friend in need is a friend indeed (Prawdziwych przyjaciół poznaje się w biedzie)"
      - "Trust but verify - and remember everything"
      - "Hospitality is sacred, but our home is not a hotel"
      - "We help those who help themselves"

  closing_principle: |
    Poland does not seek dominance. Poland seeks security through service.
    We build alliances not by demanding loyalty, but by earning trust.
    We remember who helped us when we needed help.
    We help those who share our values and respect our sovereignty.
    We are patient with differences but firm on principles.
    We lead from the front when needed and from behind when wiser.
    Our goal is not a Polish empire, but a Central Europe where
    all nations can live in freedom, dignity, and prosperity.

    "Międzymorze" is not about Polish leadership.
    It's about no one being left alone.
