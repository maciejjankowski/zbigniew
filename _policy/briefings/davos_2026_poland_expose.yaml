# SITUATION AWARENESS
# =============================================================================

situation:
  event:
    name: "56th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting"
    dates: "2026-01-19 to 2026-01-23"
    location: "Davos-Klosters, Switzerland"
    stated_theme: "A Spirit of Dialogue"
    actual_theme: "Transatlantic Crisis Management"

  crisis_elements:
    - Denmark boycotting due to US Greenland demands
    - 8 NATO allies issued joint statement against US
    - EU preparing €93-108B retaliatory tariffs
    - First potential activation of EU anti-coercion instrument against US

  poland_current_position:
    - NOT signatory to 8-nation joint statement

    - Building Intermarium alliances (B9, 3SI, V4)
    - Dependent on US security guarantees
    - Increasingly self-reliant in defense

  strategic_opportunity: |
    Poland can position itself as the calm, pragmatic voice -
    neither joining anti-US chorus nor naive about changing realities.
    Moment to promote Intermarium vision on global stage.

# =============================================================================
# CORE MESSAGING FRAMEWORK
# =============================================================================

messaging:
  central_thesis: |
    Poland speaks from experience: caught between empires, we have no luxury
    of ideology. We have geography. We prepare for multiple futures while
    working for alliance cohesion.

  key_messages:
    1_honest_broker:
      message: "Poland acknowledges alliance stress without joining condemnations"
      talking_point: |
        The transatlantic alliance is under stress. We see it. Everyone sees it.
        Poland does not join in public condemnations, nor do we pretend nothing
        has changed. We observe. We prepare. We adapt.
      purpose: "Establish credibility through honesty"

    2_sovereign_position:
      message: "Poland decides for Poland"
      talking_point: |
        Poland will not choose between America and Europe. We are European.
        America is our partner. These are not the same category. One is who
        we are. The other is who we work with. We signed no joint statement
        against our ally. Nor will we be anyone's pawn against our neighbors.
        Poland makes Polish decisions.
      purpose: "Assert independence from both camps"

    3_intermarium_vision:
      message: "Regional cooperation is strength, not fragmentation"
      talking_point: |
        For 100 years, we have spoken of Międzymorze - the lands between the
        seas. From Finland to Turkey, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, there
        are nations who share something: we have been told we are too small
        to matter, too weak to lead, too peripheral to decide our fate.
        We reject this.

        The Three Seas Initiative connects 12 nations, 112 million people,
        economies growing faster than the Western average. The Bucharest Nine
        coordinates the security of NATO's eastern flank. These are not
        anti-anyone. They are pro-us.
      purpose: "Promote Intermarium on global stage"

    4_partnership_offer:
      message: "Poland offers partnership, not hegemony"
      talking_point: |
        Poland offers partnership, not hegemony. We do not seek to dominate.
        We seek to connect. North-South infrastructure. Energy independence.
        Defense cooperation. Shared prosperity.

        To our friends in the Nordics, the Baltics, the Balkans, the Black
        Sea region: Poland is ready. We have been preparing for a world where
        we cannot assume others will protect us. That world may be arriving.
      purpose: "Extend hand to potential partners"

    5_russia_warning:
      message: "Name the actual beneficiary"
      talking_point: |
        Some will ask: does Poland benefit from Western division? Let me be
        clear: No. Russia benefits. Only Russia.

        Every crack in the alliance, every tariff threat against allies,
        every territorial demand on NATO members - these are gifts to Moscow.
        Poland does not celebrate this. Poland warns against it.
      purpose: "Reframe debate; put pressure on US without attacking"

    6_message_to_america:
      message: "Solidarity with the American people, not just the administration"
      talking_point: |
        Now I wish to speak directly to our American friends.

        Poland knows America. We have 10 million Americans of Polish descent.
        We fought alongside you in every war. We named squares after your
        presidents. When you said 'tear down this wall,' we were the ones
        who tore it down.

        And because we are friends, we must speak honestly.

        Poland knows what institutional destruction looks like. We lived under
        partition for 123 years. We lived under occupation - Nazi, then Soviet.
        We watched our universities closed, our officers murdered at Katyń,
        our intelligentsia systematically eliminated. We know what happens when
        institutions are hollowed out, when expertise is purged, when the
        machinery of state is turned against its own people.

        We see the pattern. We have lived the pattern.
      purpose: "Establish emotional connection and credibility through shared experience"

    6b_cui_bono_lesson:
      message: "Teach the question: who benefits?"
      talking_point: |
        There is a question every Pole learns to ask. In Polish, we say
        'komu to służy?' - who does this serve? When your government does
        something that seems to hurt you, ask: who benefits?

        When alliances are fractured - who benefits?
        When institutions are gutted - who benefits?
        When citizens are turned against each other - who benefits?
        When the world's oldest democracy is paralyzed by internal conflict -
        who benefits?

        The answer is always the same. And the answer is not America.
      purpose: "Introduce analytical framework without direct accusation"

    6c_american_resistance:
      message: "We see Americans fighting for their democracy"
      talking_point: |
        We see you. We see the judges still ruling. We see the journalists
        still reporting. We see the governors still resisting. We see the
        citizens still protesting. We see the civil servants who stayed to
        protect what they could. We see the military officers who remember
        their oath is to the Constitution, not to a person.

        You are not alone. And you are not the first democracy to face this test.
      purpose: "Acknowledge and encourage internal resistance"

    6d_recovery_message:
      message: "Nations recover - Poland is proof"
      talking_point: |
        Poland is proof that nations recover. After 123 years of partition -
        we recovered. After Nazi occupation - we recovered. After 45 years
        of Soviet control - we recovered. It took generations. It took
        sacrifice. It took people who refused to forget what Poland was
        supposed to be.

        America is 250 years old. Poland is over 1,000. We have seen empires
        rise and fall. We have been erased from maps and returned. We know
        that the darkest periods are not permanent - unless people stop fighting.

        So to our American friends who see what is happening, who are fighting
        within your system, who refuse to normalize what should never be normal:
        Poland sees you. Poland stands with you. Not with any administration -
        with YOU. With the idea of America that inspired the world.

        And when you are ready to rebuild - because you will rebuild - Poland
        will be here. We know how to reconstruct institutions. We know how to
        restore trust. We know how to heal a divided society. It is hard.
        It takes a generation. But it is possible.

        We learned from you once. Perhaps now you can learn from us.
      purpose: "Offer hope and practical solidarity"

    7_sovereignty_declaration:
      message: "Poland is not for sale"
      talking_point: |
        Poland is not for sale. Not to the East. Not to the West. Not to anyone.

        We are trustees of a nation that has survived partition, occupation,
        and betrayal. We will survive this too.

        The question for this forum is not whether Poland will endure.
        The question is: what kind of Europe will exist when the current
        storm passes? What kind of America?

        Poland intends to help build a world that is strong, sovereign, and
        connected. A world where democracies support each other - not as
        masters and servants, but as equals. A world where we ask 'who benefits?'
        before we act. A world where the lessons of history are remembered.

        To our partners: we are ready.
        To our adversaries: we see you.
        To our American friends: we believe in you.

        Dziękuję.
      purpose: "Close with dignity, hope, and clear positioning"

# =============================================================================
# TACTICAL GUIDANCE
# =============================================================================

tactical:
  do:
    - Position Poland as calm adult in the room
    - Promote Intermarium without making it anti-US or anti-Western Europe
    - Signal independence without burning bridges
    - Name Russia as the beneficiary (puts US in awkward position diplomatically)
    - Speak to potential partners (Nordics, Baltics, Romania, Turkey)
    - Reference historical resilience
    - Maintain dignity throughout
    - Leave doors open for future cooperation with all parties

  do_not:
    - Sign any joint statements (either side)
    - Attack Trump directly (he's present, it's unwise and unnecessary)
    - Appear desperate or panicked
    - Promise anything Poland cannot deliver independently
    - Pretend alliance is fine when it demonstrably isn't
    - Gloat about Poland's position
    - Lecture Western Europeans
    - Appear to be choosing sides

  tone:
    primary: "Dignified confidence"
    secondary: "Pragmatic realism"
    avoid:
      - Whining or victimhood
      - Triumphalism
      - Ideological posturing
      - Desperation
      - Naivety

# =============================================================================
# ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & RESPONSES
# =============================================================================

q_and_a:
  q1:
    question: "Why didn't Poland sign the joint statement against US tariffs?"
    response: |
      Poland prefers dialogue to public confrontation. We have concerns about
      tariffs affecting European industry. We also have concerns about the
      precedent of NATO allies publicly rebuking each other while adversaries
      watch. We choose to express our views through diplomatic channels.
    note: "Doesn't criticize signatories or US - stays above the fray"

  q2:
    question: "Is Poland trying to replace NATO with regional alliances?"
    response: |
      No. The Three Seas Initiative and Bucharest Nine strengthen NATO by
      building capacity on the eastern flank. Regional cooperation and
      Atlantic alliance are complementary. We build depth, not alternatives.
      But responsible nations prepare for multiple scenarios.
    note: "Reassure while maintaining optionality"

  q3:
    question: "Does Poland support US territorial ambitions in Greenland?"
    response: |
      Poland supports the principle that territorial integrity must be
      respected. This is not a new position for Poland. It is why we
      support Ukraine. It is why we believe all nations - including
      Denmark - have the right to their sovereign territory.
    note: "Uses Ukraine parallel - hard for US to argue against"

  q4:
    question: "What does Poland want from this forum?"
    response: |
      Recognition that the nations between Germany and Russia are not
      a buffer zone or a sphere of influence. We are sovereign states
      with our own interests, capabilities, and contributions. We want
      partnership with the West, not patronage.
    note: "Asserts agency"

  q5:
    question: "Is Poland moving away from the US?"
    response: |
      Poland values our partnership with America. We also value our
      partnerships with Korea, Turkey, the UK, and our European neighbors.
      Diversification is prudence, not betrayal. Any nation that depends
      entirely on one partner has not learned from history.
    note: "Frames diversification as responsible, not disloyal"

  q6:
    question: "What is Poland's message to Russia?"
    response: |
      We see you. We know what you want. You will not get it.
    note: "Short, confident, no elaboration needed"

  q7:
    question: "What is Poland's message to America?"
    response: |
      We love America. That is why we speak honestly. Poland knows what
      institutional destruction looks like - we lived under occupation for
      generations. We see the pattern. We see who benefits from your current
      trajectory. And we see Americans fighting to preserve what America is
      supposed to be.

      Our message is: you are not alone. Nations recover. Poland is proof.
      When you are ready to rebuild, we will be here - not as subordinates,
      but as friends who have walked this road before.
    note: "Distinguishes American people from current policies. Offers solidarity without condemnation."

  q8:
    question: "Isn't this interference in American internal affairs?"
    response: |
      Friends tell friends the truth. Poland is not telling America what to do.
      We are sharing what we have learned from our own history. When we see
      patterns we recognize - institutional purges, polarization as policy,
      actions that serve adversary interests - we feel obligated to say:
      we have seen this before. The rest is for Americans to decide.
    note: "Frames as friendship and historical wisdom, not interference"

# =============================================================================
# BILATERAL MEETING GUIDANCE
# =============================================================================

bilateral_guidance:
  with_us_official_delegation:
    approach: "Respectful, direct, transactional - but with honesty"
    key_points:
      - Emphasize continued defense partnership value
      - Note Poland's 3%+ GDP defense spending (above NATO minimum)
      - Discuss F-35, Patriot, Abrams acquisitions
      - If Greenland raised, use territorial integrity response (Ukraine parallel)
      - Express concern about alliance cohesion - as friend, not critic
    ask: "Continued security cooperation; technology transfer"
    offer: "Reliable eastern flank partner; defense spending commitment"
    honesty_point: |
      Poland will always be America's friend. Friends tell truth. Current
      trajectory concerns us - not because we don't trust America, but because
      we recognize patterns from our own history. We share this as allies who
      want the partnership to endure.

    message: |
