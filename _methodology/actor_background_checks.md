# ACTOR BACKGROUND CHECKS

*People design institutions. Track records predict behavior. Check the architects, not just the architecture.*

---

## THE PRINCIPLE

Every significant policy, instrument, or institution was designed and promoted by specific individuals. Their track records — competence, conflicts of interest, patterns of behavior — are material evidence when assessing whether the instrument will function as advertised.

This is not ad hominem. Ad hominem dismisses an argument because of who makes it. Background checks evaluate whether the people managing a €44 billion instrument have managed similar things competently before.

---

## WHEN TO APPLY

Apply actor background checks when:

1. **Large financial instruments** — Who designed the terms? Who benefits from the structure?
2. **Policy with long-term binding commitments** — Who negotiated the conditions? What have they negotiated before?
3. **Institutional power transfers** — Who gains authority? What did they do with previous authority?
4. **Procurement programmes** — Who selected the suppliers? What are their industry connections?

**Do NOT apply** for routine policy analysis or when individual actors are interchangeable (pure structural analysis).

## THE METHOD

### Step 1: Identify Key Actors

Map the decision chain:

| Role | Actor | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Architect** | Who designed the instrument? | Structure reflects their interests |
| **Political Sponsor** | Who champions it publicly? | Political cover reveals political logic |
| **Operational Lead** | Who implements it? | Execution reveals real priorities |
| **National Promoter** | Who pushes it domestically? | Domestic framing reveals local incentives |
| **Key Opponent** | Who opposes and why? | Opposition arguments contain signal |

### Step 2: Background Check Per Actor

For each key actor, investigate:

```markdown
### [Name] — [Role]

| Fact | Source | Relevance to Current Instrument |
|------|--------|---------------------------------|
| [Track record item] | [Sourced] | [Why it matters here] |
| [Conflict of interest] | [Sourced] | [Why it matters here] |
| [Prior similar action] | [Sourced] | [Pattern or one-off?] |

**Pattern**: [Summary of what their track record suggests]
**Confidence**: [HIGH/MODERATE/LOW based on source quality]
```

### Step 3: Check for Patterns

Key questions per actor:
1. **Competence**: Have they managed similar things before? How did those turn out?
2. **Conflicts of interest**: Do they or their former employers benefit from this instrument?
3. **Transparency**: When investigated previously, did they cooperate or obstruct?
4. **Consistency**: Do their actions match their stated positions?
5. **Revolving door**: Did they move from industry to regulator (or vice versa) in this domain?

### Step 4: The Bad Apples Matrix

Summarize all actors in a single table:

```markdown
| Person | Role | Documented Concern | Severity |
|--------|------|-------------------|----------|
| [Name] | [Role] | [Summary] | HIGH/MODERATE/LOW/NONE |
```

**Severity guide:**
- **HIGH**: Documented scandal, investigation, evidence destruction, or institutional failure in their area of responsibility
- **MODERATE**: Pattern of decisions that benefited specific interests; inconsistency between stated and actual positions
- **LOW**: Minor concerns; largely clean record with isolated issues
- **NONE**: Clean record. Note this explicitly — absence of concern is data.

### Step 5: Pattern Assessment

Answer the uncomfortable question:

> "Can people with these documented track records be trusted to manage [instrument] in the interest of [stated beneficiary] for [duration]?"

This is not about proving conspiracy. It's about assessing whether past behavior predicts future stewardship.

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

### What This Is
- Pattern recognition applied to people, not just policies
- Track record analysis — documented actions, sourced
- Risk assessment based on prior behavior

### What This Is NOT
- Character assassination — every claim must be sourced
- Guilt by association — proximity ≠ coordination
- Ad hominem — we evaluate the instrument independently; actor checks are ADDITIONAL evidence

### Standards
1. **Every claim sourced.** No unsourced accusations.
2. **Counterarguments included.** Note when an actor's record is clean or when negative items have explanations.
3. **Confidence per claim.** Not a blanket "this person is bad."
4. **Relevance filter.** Only include track record items that are relevant to the instrument being assessed. A politician's personal life is not relevant to their procurement decisions unless there's a direct conflict of interest.

## TEMPLATE

```markdown
## PERSONNEL FILE: [INSTRUMENT NAME]

### Methodology Note
This is pattern recognition applied to people. Every claim is sourced.
Counterarguments are noted. Relevance to the current instrument is required.

### TIER 1: THE ARCHITECTS
[People who designed the instrument]

#### [Name] — [Role]
| Fact | Source | Relevance |
|------|--------|-----------|
| | | |

**Pattern**:
**Confidence**:

### TIER 2: THE PROMOTERS
[People pushing the instrument domestically]

#### [Name] — [Role]
| Fact | Source | Relevance |
|------|--------|-----------|
| | | |

**Pattern**:
**Confidence**:

### The Bad Apples Matrix

| Person | Role | Concern | Severity |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| | | | |

### The Uncomfortable Pattern
[What the aggregate record tells you about likely stewardship]
```

## EXAMPLE

**Instrument**: EU SAFE Programme (€150B defence loans)

**Key finding**: The Commission President (von der Leyen) ran the Bundeswehr into the ground, destroyed phone evidence during a procurement investigation, and is under EPPO investigation for opaque vaccine mega-deals. The intellectual architect (Breton) ran a company with FSB-licensed Russian operations, then moved to the Commission to design procurement rules benefiting his former industry. The Polish promoter (Tusk) facilitated Nord Stream while allied with Merkel — the same core-periphery pattern SAFE repeats.

**One actor had a clean record** (Kubilius). Noting clean records is as important as flagging dirty ones.

## INTEGRATION

| Extends | How |
|---------|-----|
| `cui_bono.md` | Adds personnel dimension to beneficiary analysis |
| `pattern_mapping.md` | Individual track records as pattern evidence |
| `validation_gate.md` | All personnel claims must pass source verification |
| `cognitive_biases.md` | Watch for ad hominem bias — stay on sourced facts |

---

## ORIGIN

Developed during `asmt_2026_004_safe_program` (Addendum II: The Personnel File). Field-tested on von der Leyen, Breton, Kubilius, Tusk, Sikorski — five actors, three tiers of concern identified.
