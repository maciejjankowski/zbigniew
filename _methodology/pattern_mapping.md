# PATTERN MAPPING FRAMEWORK

*Individual events are noise. Patterns across vectors are signal.*

---

## THE PRINCIPLE

Single events can be explained many ways:
- Coincidence
- Incompetence
- Unintended consequences
- Legitimate policy disagreement

But when multiple events across different domains all produce the same beneficiary, the probability of coincidence decreases exponentially.

## VECTOR ANALYSIS

### Define Your Vectors

Standard geopolitical vectors:

| Vector | What to Track |
|--------|---------------|
| **INSTITUTIONAL** | Agency capacity, civil service, rule of law |
| **ALLIANCE** | NATO, EU, bilateral treaties, trust levels |
| **ECONOMIC** | Trade, sanctions, currency, investment |
| **INFORMATION** | Media, platforms, propaganda, censorship |
| **MILITARY** | Posture, readiness, deployments, doctrine |
| **POLITICAL** | Polarization, elections, democratic norms |
| **SOCIAL** | Civil unrest, migration, public trust |

### Map Events to Vectors

For each significant event:
1. Which vector(s) does it affect?
2. What direction (strengthen/weaken)?
3. Who benefits from that directional change?

---

## PATTERN RECOGNITION METHOD

### Step 1: Event Collection
Gather events over a defined time period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year)
- Policy decisions
- Personnel changes
- Official statements
- Actions taken

### Step 2: Vector Mapping
For each event, complete:

```markdown
| Event | Date | Vector | Direction | Primary Beneficiary |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Event 1] | YYYY-MM-DD | ALLIANCE | Weakens | Russia |
| [Event 2] | YYYY-MM-DD | INSTITUTIONAL | Weakens | Executive |
| [Event 3] | YYYY-MM-DD | ECONOMIC | Neutral | Domestic industry |
```

### Step 3: Beneficiary Aggregation

Count beneficiaries across all events:

```markdown
| Beneficiary | Events Benefiting | Vectors Affected |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Russia | 12 | ALLIANCE, INSTITUTIONAL, INFORMATION |
| China | 8 | ALLIANCE, ECONOMIC |
| Domestic X | 15 | POLITICAL, INSTITUTIONAL |
```

### Step 4: Pattern Assessment

**Questions to answer:**
- Is there a consistent beneficiary across multiple vectors?
- Does the pattern match any documented strategy?
- What's the probability this is coincidental?

---

## CROSS-REFERENCE WITH DOCUMENTED STRATEGY

### The Key Question:
> "Does the pattern of actions match any adversary's documented strategic objectives?"

### Method:
1. Obtain adversary's official strategy documents
2. Extract stated objectives
3. Map observed events to objectives
4. Assess alignment

### Example:

**Russia NSS 2021 Stated Objectives:**
- End Western/American hegemony
- Weaken NATO
- Establish multipolarity
- Protect "information sovereignty"

**Observed Pattern:**
- NATO ally tariffs (weakens NATO)
- Alliance territorial threats (weakens NATO)
- Reduced State Dept capacity (reduces US influence)
- Social media platform control (information)

**Alignment**: HIGH - Pattern matches documented objectives

## PATTERN VISUALIZATION

### Beneficiary Heat Map

```
                 | INST | ALLIANCE | ECON | INFO | MIL | POL | SOCIAL |
-----------------+------+----------+------+------+-----+-----+--------|
Russia           |  ++  |    ++    |  +   |  ++  |  +  |  +  |   +    |
China            |  +   |    +     |  +   |  +   |  0  |  0  |   0    |
Executive Branch |  ++  |    0     |  +   |  +   |  0  | ++  |   +    |
Domestic Corps   |  +   |    0     |  ++  |  0   |  0  |  +  |   0    |

Legend: ++ Strong benefit, + Moderate benefit, 0 Neutral, - Harm
```

### Timeline Correlation

Plot events on timeline, color by beneficiary:
- Are benefiting events clustered?
- Do they follow a logical sequence?
- Do they correlate with external events?

---

## ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS

Before concluding pattern significance, consider:

### 1. Ideological Convergence
- Domestic ideology may independently produce adversary-beneficial outcomes
- "America First" ideology naturally reduces alliance commitments
- This doesn't require coordination to benefit adversaries

### 2. Incompetence
- Bad decisions happen
- Institutional failure is real
- Not everything is planned

### 3. Legitimate Policy Difference
- Reasonable people disagree on policy
- Isolationism has domestic proponents
- Not all criticism is foreign influence

### 4. Selection Bias
- Are you tracking events that confirm your hypothesis?
- What events DON'T fit the pattern?
- Are you weighting properly?

---

## PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

### Single Event
- Many explanations possible
- Coincidence highly plausible
- Low confidence warranted

### Pattern Across 2-3 Events
- Coincidence less likely but possible
- Moderate confidence if vectors differ

### Pattern Across 5+ Events, Multiple Vectors
- Coincidence increasingly improbable
- Pattern demands explanation
- Higher confidence warranted

### Pattern Matching Documented Strategy
- Very low probability of coincidence
- Question shifts from "is there a pattern?" to "what explains it?"

## NAMED PATTERNS

*Reusable analytical patterns identified through field-testing. Reference by name in assessments.*

### Pattern: DEMAND-SIDE SUBSIDY
**Definition**: When a borrower/buyer is structurally forced to purchase from specific suppliers, the financing functions as a subsidy for those suppliers — paid by the borrower, not the lender.

**Structure**: Payer → [Content/procurement rules] → Mandated suppliers → Revenue with no risk/debt/conditions

**Historical instances**:
- EU SAFE programme (Poland borrows, 65% content rule directs spending to Franco-German primes)
- Eurozone crisis (Greece borrowed cheaply in euros, spent on German/French goods)
- IMF structural adjustment (borrowers forced to open markets to lender-country firms)
- US FMS (buyer finances, ITAR restricts modification/resale)

**Detection**: Ask — "Does the borrower have genuine supplier choice, or do the rules guarantee specific suppliers' revenue?"

### Pattern: CORE-PERIPHERY EXTRACTION
**Definition**: Peripheral states borrow from institutions designed by core states, spend under rules set by core states, accept conditions enforced by core-state-dominated institutions — while core states take on no comparable obligation.

**Structure**: Periphery borrows → Core designs rules → Periphery spends at Core → Core gets revenue + zero risk

**Detection**: Ask — "Did the rule designers apply for the same instrument? If not, why not?"

### Pattern: COMPETENCE LAUNDERING
**Definition**: An actor with a documented track record of failure or scandal in Domain X is promoted to a larger role in the same domain, with the promotion itself serving as implicit evidence of competence.

**Structure**: Failed at small scale → Promoted → Failure record treated as "experience"

**Detection**: Apply actor background checks (`actor_background_checks.md`). Promotion ≠ exoneration.

### Pattern: UNFALSIFIABLE REFRAMING
**Definition**: A claim is restructured so it cannot be tested. "It's not a loan, it's an investment" removes the debt-obligation frame (loans have repayment conditions that can be evaluated; "investments" have returns that may or may not materialize).

**Structure**: Testable claim → Reframed as untestable → Criticism becomes "missing the big picture"

**Detection**: Ask — "What specific evidence would prove this reframing wrong?" If no answer, flag as narrative, not analysis.

Rigor matters. Document everything. Consider alternatives.
