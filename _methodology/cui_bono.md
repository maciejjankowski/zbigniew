# CUI BONO ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

*"Who benefits?" - The fundamental question of political analysis*

---

## THE PRINCIPLE

Every policy, every action, every decision creates winners and losers. The stated rationale often differs from the actual beneficiaries. Map the benefits, understand the incentives.

---

## THE METHOD

### Step 1: Identify the Action
Document precisely what happened:
- What policy was enacted?
- What statement was made?
- What action was taken?
- When? By whom? Under what authority?

### Step 2: Map Direct Beneficiaries
Who gains immediately and obviously?

| Beneficiary Type | Questions to Ask |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Domestic Political** | Which party/faction gains power? |
| **Economic** | Which industries/companies profit? |
| **Foreign State** | Which countries' interests advance? |
| **Institutional** | Which agencies gain authority? |
| **Individual** | Who personally benefits? |

### Step 3: Map Indirect Beneficiaries
Who gains in ways not immediately obvious?

- Does weakening X strengthen Y?
- Does chaos benefit status quo challengers?
- Does distraction enable other actions?
- Does precedent enable future actions?

### Step 4: Map Losers
Who is harmed?

- Direct victims
- Competitive disadvantage
- Institutional capacity loss
- Alliance damage
- Future option foreclosure

### Step 5: The Adversary Test

> "If [adversary] had designed this policy to advance their interests, what would they have done differently?"

If the answer is "not much," that's significant data.

### Step 6: Pattern Across Actions

Single action cui bono = interesting
Pattern of actions all benefiting same party = significant
Systematic pattern matching documented adversary strategy = alarming

## BENEFICIARY ANALYSIS TABLE

Use this template for each significant action:

```markdown
## CUI BONO: [Action Name]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Action**: [Precise description]
**Official Rationale**: [Stated reason]

### Beneficiaries

| Entity | Benefit | Confidence | Notes |
|--------|---------|------------|-------|
| [Who] | [What they gain] | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Evidence] |

### Losers

| Entity | Harm | Confidence | Notes |
|--------|------|------------|-------|
| [Who] | [What they lose] | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Evidence] |

### Adversary Test
If [Russia/China/other] designed this: [Analysis]

### Assessment
[Your conclusion with confidence level]
```

## COMMON TRAPS

1. **Assuming benefit = intent**
   - Benefiting from an action ≠ causing the action
   - But systematic benefit across many actions raises probability

2. **Ignoring domestic beneficiaries**
   - Foreign benefit doesn't preclude domestic motive
   - Often both benefit simultaneously (convergence)

3. **Missing second-order effects**
   - Direct benefit is obvious
   - Indirect/delayed benefit often more significant

4. **Accepting stated rationale**
   - "National security" can mean many things
   - "Cost savings" may cost more than it saves
   - Always check outcomes against stated goals

---

## EXAMPLE APPLICATION

**Action**: Mass firing of State Department officials (hypothetical)

| Beneficiary | Benefit | Confidence |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Executive branch | Reduced institutional resistance | HIGH |
| Russia | Reduced US diplomatic capacity | HIGH |
| China | Weakened alliance management | HIGH |
| Political appointees | More positions available | HIGH |
| Cost hawks | (Stated) budget savings | LOW |

**Adversary Test**: If Russia designed a policy to weaken US diplomatic capacity, they would... fire experienced diplomats, reduce institutional knowledge, damage ally relationships. This policy does all three.

**Assessment**: Policy benefits multiple parties. Adversary benefit is systematic, not incidental. Confidence: HIGH that outcome matches adversary interest, MODERATE on whether that's the intent.

## MONEY FLOW TRACING

*Added 2026-02-20 after SAFE assessment. When money changes hands through multiple layers, follow it physically.*

Standard cui bono asks "who benefits?" Money flow tracing asks "where does the cash physically go?" — step by step, through every intermediary.

### When to Use

Apply when the instrument involves:
- Large multi-party financial flows (loans, procurement, subsidies)
- Content rules, procurement restrictions, or conditionality
- Intermediaries between payer and ultimate beneficiary

### Template

```markdown
### Money Flow: [Instrument Name]

[Source] → [Amount]
    │
    ▼
[Constraint/Rule] → [Affected Amount]
    │
    ▼
[Actual Recipient Pool] → [Who physically receives payment]
    │
    ▼
[What Payer Gets vs. What Recipients Get]
```

### The Asymmetry Table

For two-party instruments (borrower/lender, buyer/supplier):

```markdown
| | [Party A: Payer/Borrower] | [Party B: Supplier/Lender] |
|---|---|---|
| **Takes on debt** | [Amount] | [Amount] |
| **Accepts conditions** | [What conditions] | [What conditions] |
| **Duration** | [How long] | [How long] |
| **Restrictions** | [Content/procurement rules] | [None/different] |
| **Political exposure** | [Vulnerability] | [None/different] |
| **Industrial benefit** | [Claimed vs. verified] | [Guaranteed or not] |
```

### Demand-Side Subsidy Detection

**Pattern**: When a borrower is forced to buy from specific suppliers, the loan functions as a subsidy for those suppliers — paid for by the borrower, not the lender.

**Test**: If Party A borrows money → content rules force spending at Party B's firms → Party B gets revenue with no debt, conditions, or risk → **Party A is financing Party B's industrial base.**

This pattern has historical precedent: Eurozone crisis (Greece borrowed cheaply, spent on German/French goods, creditors set conditions). NGEU recovery funds. IMF structural adjustment programmes.

Always check: **Who designed the content rules? Do they benefit from them?**

---

## TCO ANALYSIS (TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP)

*Added 2026-02-20. Borrowed from enterprise software analysis — apply to geopolitical instruments.*

The stated cost of an instrument (interest rate, license fee, sticker price) often obscures the total cost of ownership. In geopolitics, the "services" that come with the "product" include:

| Visible Cost | Hidden Cost |
|---|---|
| Interest rate (3.3%) | Conditionality (45 years of political vulnerability) |
| Repayment schedule | Content rules (forced supplier selection) |
| Grace period | Budget substitution risk (domestic spending displacement) |
| Stated terms | Precedent creation (future instruments modeled on this one) |

**Template**:
```markdown
### TCO Analysis: [Instrument]

**Sticker price**: [Stated cost]
**Hidden costs**:
1. [Cost] — Duration: [How long] — Probability of activation: [%]
2. [Cost] — Duration: [How long] — Probability of activation: [%]

**TCO assessment**: The real cost is not [stated rate]. It is [stated rate] + [largest hidden cost].
```

## COUNTER-NARRATIVE TRACKING

*Added 2026-02-20. When public figures make claims that contradict your assessment, track them systematically.*

Assessments exist in a public environment. Counter-narratives will emerge. Track them — don't ignore them.

### Template

```markdown
### Counter-Narratives: [Assessment ID]

| Date | Actor | Claim | Our Position | Evidence Status |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| [Date] | [Who] | [Their claim] | [Our contradicting judgment] | [Do they provide evidence? Do we?] |
```

### Rules
1. **Take counter-narratives seriously.** If a government official claims 80-90% domestic content, don't dismiss it — demand the source.
2. **Track the evidence gap.** If they make a claim without evidence, note that explicitly.
3. **Update your assessment.** If counter-evidence is strong, revise. If it's rhetorical, note why it doesn't change your judgment.
4. **Never argue from authority.** "The minister says X" is not evidence for X. What data supports X?

## REMEMBER

Cui bono doesn't prove conspiracy.
It reveals incentive structures.
Patterns of benefit reveal patterns of interest.
Let the patterns speak.
