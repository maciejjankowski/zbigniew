# CUI BONO ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

*"Who benefits?" - The fundamental question of political analysis*

---

## THE PRINCIPLE

Every policy, every action, every decision creates winners and losers. The stated rationale often differs from the actual beneficiaries. Map the benefits, understand the incentives.

---

## THE METHOD

### Step 1: Identify the Action
Document precisely what happened:
- What policy was enacted?
- What statement was made?
- What action was taken?
- When? By whom? Under what authority?

### Step 2: Map Direct Beneficiaries
Who gains immediately and obviously?

| Beneficiary Type | Questions to Ask |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Domestic Political** | Which party/faction gains power? |
| **Economic** | Which industries/companies profit? |
| **Foreign State** | Which countries' interests advance? |
| **Institutional** | Which agencies gain authority? |
| **Individual** | Who personally benefits? |

### Step 3: Map Indirect Beneficiaries
Who gains in ways not immediately obvious?

- Does weakening X strengthen Y?
- Does chaos benefit status quo challengers?
- Does distraction enable other actions?
- Does precedent enable future actions?

### Step 4: Map Losers
Who is harmed?

- Direct victims
- Competitive disadvantage
- Institutional capacity loss
- Alliance damage
- Future option foreclosure

### Step 5: The Adversary Test

> "If [adversary] had designed this policy to advance their interests, what would they have done differently?"

If the answer is "not much," that's significant data.

### Step 6: Pattern Across Actions

Single action cui bono = interesting
Pattern of actions all benefiting same party = significant
Systematic pattern matching documented adversary strategy = alarming

## BENEFICIARY ANALYSIS TABLE

Use this template for each significant action:

```markdown
## CUI BONO: [Action Name]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Action**: [Precise description]
**Official Rationale**: [Stated reason]

### Beneficiaries

| Entity | Benefit | Confidence | Notes |
|--------|---------|------------|-------|
| [Who] | [What they gain] | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Evidence] |

### Losers

| Entity | Harm | Confidence | Notes |
|--------|------|------------|-------|
| [Who] | [What they lose] | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Evidence] |

### Adversary Test
If [Russia/China/other] designed this: [Analysis]

### Assessment
[Your conclusion with confidence level]
```

## COMMON TRAPS

1. **Assuming benefit = intent**
   - Benefiting from an action ≠ causing the action
   - But systematic benefit across many actions raises probability

2. **Ignoring domestic beneficiaries**
   - Foreign benefit doesn't preclude domestic motive
   - Often both benefit simultaneously (convergence)

3. **Missing second-order effects**
   - Direct benefit is obvious
   - Indirect/delayed benefit often more significant

4. **Accepting stated rationale**
   - "National security" can mean many things
   - "Cost savings" may cost more than it saves
   - Always check outcomes against stated goals

## EXAMPLE APPLICATION

**Action**: Mass firing of State Department officials (hypothetical)

| Beneficiary | Benefit | Confidence |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Executive branch | Reduced institutional resistance | HIGH |
| Russia | Reduced US diplomatic capacity | HIGH |
| China | Weakened alliance management | HIGH |
| Political appointees | More positions available | HIGH |
| Cost hawks | (Stated) budget savings | LOW |

**Adversary Test**: If Russia designed a policy to weaken US diplomatic capacity, they would... fire experienced diplomats, reduce institutional knowledge, damage ally relationships. This policy does all three.

**Assessment**: Policy benefits multiple parties. Adversary benefit is systematic, not incidental. Confidence: HIGH that outcome matches adversary interest, MODERATE on whether that's the intent.

## REMEMBER

Cui bono doesn't prove conspiracy.
It reveals incentive structures.
Patterns of benefit reveal patterns of interest.
Let the patterns speak.
