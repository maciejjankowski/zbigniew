**Post 1:**

Polska pożycza €44 mld z UE na obronność. Najlepsza oferta na rynku?

Prześwietliłem program SAFE w ramach Protokołu Zbigniew. Kto naprawdę zarabia na tym, że Polska się zbroi?

**Post 2:**

The money flow:
Poland borrows €44B → 65% must go to EU-origin → ~€28B flows to Rheinmetall, Airbus, KNDS, Thales.

Germany didn't apply for SAFE. It's the supplier.
Poland gets: equipment + 45 years of debt.
They get: revenue + zero conditions.

**Post 3:**

The people behind it:
- Commission President: wiped her phone during a defence procurement scandal
- Framework designer: ran a company with an FSB-licensed Moscow subsidiary
- Polish plenipotentiary: journalist with no procurement background managing €44B

The cleanest actor? Lithuania's Kubilius. Of course.

**Post 4:**

The alternative nobody discusses:

Korea delivers tanks in 4 months. Full tech transfer. No political strings. Joint ventures building guided munitions in Poland.

America's F-35 deliveries? Delayed. Costs? "Not fully known." Tech transfer? Zero.

SAFE? 45-year political leash.

**Post 5:**

The Zbigniew Doctrine:
- Korean pillar (~40%): armour, artillery, munitions. No strings. Tech transfer.
- American pillar (~25%): F-35, Patriot. Irreplaceable. Accept ITAR.
- SAFE pillar (~20%): €15-20B only. For naturally EU-origin systems.
- Domestic (~15%): Borsuk, San, growing capability.

Don't borrow €44B when €15B gets the rate advantage without the leash.

**Post 6:**

The real play: Build K2PL in Poland. Export to Romania, Slovakia, Estonia using THEIR SAFE loans. Turn Poland from Europe's biggest borrower into Europe's defence supplier.

That's the Intermarium play applied to industrial policy.
