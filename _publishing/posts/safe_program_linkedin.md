Poland just committed to borrowing €43.7 billion from the EU under the SAFE defence instrument. The largest allocation of any member state. 45-year maturity. 3.3% interest.

Sounds great. So I decided to do what nobody in the Sejm debate seemed to do: follow the money.

Here's what I found:

The 65% EU-content rule means ~€28 billion must be spent on systems made by Franco-German defence primes. Germany didn't apply for SAFE loans — it's a supplier, not a borrower. Rheinmetall stock is up 400% since 2022. Poland gets the equipment and 45 years of debt. They get the revenue and zero conditions.

The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation (2020/2092) is attached. The same mechanism used to freeze Hungary's funds. Defence procurement can be held hostage to political disputes that have nothing to do with defence.

The Commission President who sponsors SAFE had her phone wiped during a Bundeswehr procurement scandal. The former Commissioner who designed the framework ran a company with an FSB-licensed Moscow subsidiary building EU border systems.

The Russian threat is real. Poland needs to rearm. But there were better ways to do it.

I've published a full Zbigniew Protocol intelligence assessment covering:
- The financial terms (legitimately good)
- The conditionality trap (legitimately dangerous)
- Who really cashes the €44B check (not Poland)
- The personnel file of who's pushing this
- What a three-pillar Korea/US/selective-SAFE model would look like instead

Pattern recognition, not prophecy. Verified sources only.
