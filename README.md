# ZBIGNIEW PROTOCOL

**Open-Source Political Intelligence Analysis Framework**

*Pattern recognition, not prophecy. Verified sources only.*

---

## What Is This?

A systematic methodology for analyzing political events, policy decisions, and geopolitical patterns using only open-source intelligence (OSINT).

Designed for:
- **Thinking** - Rigorous analytical methodology
- **Publishing** - Accessible intelligence assessments
- **Recordkeeping** - Timestamped timelines and tracked predictions

---

## Core Principles

1. **Verified Sources Only** - Primary documents, quality journalism, no speculation as fact
2. **Cui Bono** - Always ask who benefits
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Individual events are noise; patterns across vectors are signal
4. **Falsifiability** - State what would prove you wrong
5. **Timestamp Everything** - Accountability through documentation

---

## Quick Start

```
# Read the framework
cat CLAUDE.md

# Check methodology
ls _methodology/

# Create an assessment
cp _assessments/templates/full_assessment.md _assessments/active/my_assessment.md

# Log an event
# Append to _timeline/events.jsonl

# Make a prediction
# Append to _predictions/active.jsonl
```

## Assessment Workflow

1. **OBSERVE** - Log events to `_timeline/`
2. **PATTERN** - Map across vectors, identify beneficiaries
3. **ANALYZE** - Apply cui bono, check against documented strategies
4. **PUBLISH** - Use templates, cite sources, state confidence
5. **TRACK** - Log predictions, update when resolved

---

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 5 | CONFIRMED | Primary source documentation |
| 4 | HIGH | Multiple reliable sources agree |
| 3 | MODERATE | Logical inference from facts |
| 2 | LOW | Single source or circumstantial |
| 1 | SPECULATIVE | Pattern suggests, evidence thin |

*"The question is not 'who is an asset.' The question is: 'Why does this policy portfolio perfectly match the wish-list of adversaries?'"*
